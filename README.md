# openQA-module-mapper

### _Find where an openQA module is running_

OMM is an open source tool written in go.  
It aims to help openQA test developers locate where any perl module has been running in [openqa.suse.de](openqa.suse.de) and [openqa.opensuse.org](openqa.opensuse.org).

Goals:
* Provide a tool that allows for more complete verification runs
* Help to track module coverage of tests in openQA
* Learn some go along the way
